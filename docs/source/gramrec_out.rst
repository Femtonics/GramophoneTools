Velocity data
=============

Each .vlg file contains as many groups as many recordings were made. Each recording has a unique identifier eg.: 12EB29805B3652C7 that is the name of the group.

The groups have two datasets:

time
    An array of 64 bit floats that contain the time in milliseconds
velocity
    An array of 64 bit floats that contain the velocity in counts/second. One full rotation of the disk is 14400 counts.
