Introduction
============

Femtonics Gramophone is a single-dimension locomotion tracking device for mice. 
With the GramophoneTools Python package you can record locomotion in conjunction 
with two-photon measurements (see: :doc:`gramrec`), or train mice in a simple 
virtual linear maze (see: :doc:`linmaze`). For information on how to use the device
please refer to the user manual (available as a pdf below).
